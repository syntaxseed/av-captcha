## Getting True Type Fonts - Windows

Since you can use Microsoft's TrueType fonts but cannot redistribute them, this means I cannot include them in this script. However, to the best of my knowledge you can download and use them yourself.

1) Download the .exe file for the font you want here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/corefonts/files/the%20fonts/
2) Extract/install the exe to your computer.
3) Find the .ttf file in your Windows/Fonts directory and copy it to the resources folder in this avcaptcha directory.
4) Edit the settings in avcaptcha.php to set the correct font file.
